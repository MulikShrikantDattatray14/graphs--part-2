Problem Statement: Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. 

Time Complexity: O(N + 2E) + O(N), Where N = Nodes, 2E is for total degrees as we traverse all adjacent nodes. In the case of connected components of a graph, it will take another O(N) time.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N) ~ O(N), Space for queue data structure and visited array.
