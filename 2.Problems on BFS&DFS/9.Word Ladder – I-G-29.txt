Given are the two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list denoting wordList of unique words of equal lengths. Find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from startWord to targetWord.

In this problem statement, we need to keep the following conditions in mind:

A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
startWord may or may not be part of the wordList
Note:  If thereâ€™s no possible way to transform the sequence from startWord to targetWord return 0.


Time Complexity: O(N * M * 26)

Where N = size of wordList Array and M = word length of words present in the wordList..

Note that, hashing operations in an unordered set takes O(1) time, but if you want to use set here, then the time complexity would increase by a factor of log(N) as hashing operations in a set take O(log(N)) time.

Space Complexity:  O( N ) { for creating an unordered set and copying all values from wordList into it }

Where N = size of wordList Array.
