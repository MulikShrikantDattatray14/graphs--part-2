Problem Statement: Given a grid of size NxM (N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns in the grid) consisting of ‘0’s (Water) and ‘1’s(Land). Find the number of islands.

Note: An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.

Time Complexity ~ O(N² + NxMx9), N² for the nested loops, and NxMx9 for the overall DFS of the matrix, that will happen throughout if all the cells are filled with 1.

Space Complexity: O(N²) for visited array max queue space O(N²), If all are marked as 1 then the maximum queue space will be N².
