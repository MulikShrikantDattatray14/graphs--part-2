Problem Statement: Given a directed graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. 

Time Complexity: O(V+E)+O(V) , where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. There can be at most V components. So, another O(V) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(2N) + O(N) ~ O(2N): O(2N) for two visited arrays and O(N) for recursive stack space.
